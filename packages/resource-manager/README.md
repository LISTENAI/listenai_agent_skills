# @listenai/eaw-resource-manager

<h4 align="right"><strong>English</strong> | <a href="README.zh-CN.md">简体中文</a></h4>

This package owns the resource-manager runtime surface for the workspace. It exports the in-memory manager, HTTP app/server helpers, lease management, DSLogic provider integration, and a CLI that starts the HTTP server. The shipped dashboard and API now present the native `dsview-cli` runtime as the backend truth surface, including `ready`, `degraded`, `missing`, and `unsupported` states.

If you are trying to use the server from this repository, start here instead of inferring behavior from the repo root.

## What this package exposes

Use the package root as the canonical import surface:

```ts
import {
  InMemoryResourceManager,
  LeaseManager,
  createApp,
  createServer,
  createDeviceProvider,
  type SnapshotResourceManager
} from "@listenai/eaw-resource-manager";
```

The package also ships a CLI bin named `resource-manager`. Published packages wire the bin to compiled `dist/cli.js`.

## Private registry setup

`@listenai` packages are expected to resolve from the ListenAI private registry:

```text
https://registry-lpm.listenai.com
```

Configure the `@listenai` scope in npm, pnpm, yarn, or CI before installing. Do not commit auth tokens to the repository.

## Start the server from the registry

The recommended user path is to run the package binary from the private registry:

```bash
npm exec --package @listenai/eaw-resource-manager -- \
  resource-manager start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7600

pnpm dlx --package @listenai/eaw-resource-manager \
  resource-manager start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7600

yarn dlx @listenai/eaw-resource-manager \
  resource-manager start --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7600
```

M003 adds managed background mode for agents and long-lived local workflows:

```bash
resource-manager start --daemon --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7600
resource-manager status --json
resource-manager stop
```

The daemon is intended to be a user-home global singleton that can be reused across terminal sessions and projects. Until daemon mode is available in a published package, foreground startup remains the supported runtime path.

## Prerequisites for contributing from source

- Node.js 22
- pnpm 10.33.0
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` run from the repository root in a fresh workspace

## Start the server from the repository while contributing

Source workspace commands are for contributors. From the repository root, the direct development command is:

```bash
pnpm --filter @listenai/eaw-resource-manager exec tsx src/cli.ts --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7600
```

CLI options:

- `--host`, `-h`: bind host, defaults to `0.0.0.0` so the dashboard and API are reachable from your LAN; use `127.0.0.1` when you want loopback-only access
- `--port`, `-p`: bind port, defaults to `7600`
- `--provider`: device provider, `dslogic` by default, `fake` for local smoke tests
- `--inventoryPollIntervalMs`: optional inventory refresh cadence in milliseconds; controls how quickly hot-plug changes reach `/inventory`, `/devices`, and `/dashboard-events`
- `--leaseScanIntervalMs`: optional lease expiry scan cadence in milliseconds; controls how quickly expired allocations are released

The CLI also reads `RESOURCE_MANAGER_PROVIDER`, `RESOURCE_MANAGER_INVENTORY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, and `RESOURCE_MANAGER_LEASE_SCAN_INTERVAL_MS`; if both env vars and CLI flags are present, the CLI flags win.

Default `dslogic` startup assumes the host already has the native `dsview-cli` runtime available. This README intentionally documents what operators should observe from `/inventory`, `/dashboard-snapshot`, and the browser dashboard when that runtime is healthy, degraded, missing, or unsupported; it does not prescribe platform-specific install commands.

Examples:

```bash
# Default DSLogic-backed startup
pnpm --filter @listenai/eaw-resource-manager exec tsx src/cli.ts

# Force the fake provider for local smoke tests while keeping the runtime LAN-visible
pnpm --filter @listenai/eaw-resource-manager exec tsx src/cli.ts --provider fake --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7600

# Equivalent provider selection through env
RESOURCE_MANAGER_PROVIDER=fake pnpm --filter @listenai/eaw-resource-manager exec tsx src/cli.ts --port 7600
```

When startup succeeds, the process logs `Server listening on http://<host>:<port>`.
When the host is `0.0.0.0`, connect from the same machine with `127.0.0.1` and from another LAN device with this machine's IPv4 address.

## Operator path

The shipped operator path is one runtime, one browser entrypoint, and one acceptance seam:

1. Start the packaged `resource-manager` CLI.
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:7600/` from the same machine, or `http://<machine-ip>:7600/` from another device on the same LAN when the host binding is `0.0.0.0`.
3. Use the dashboard and `/dashboard-snapshot` as the operator truth surface for device occupancy, owner identity, lease timing, and native runtime readiness, while keeping the M010 DSLogic support claim explicit: macOS via `dsview-cli` is the only live-proven host path, and the only ready device claim on that path is the classic DSLogic Plus variant; Linux and Windows remain readiness-modeled future paths.
4. Treat `bash scripts/verify-m010-s05.sh` or `pnpm run verify:m010:s05` as the top-level acceptance seam for this operator story.

That seam fails fast on stale dashboard/doc wording, reruns the focused dashboard and package proof surfaces, and rechecks the operator docs for the current macOS `dsview-cli` live-proof wording, the classic DSLogic Plus ready path, the typed `ready`, `degraded`, `missing`, and `unsupported` labels, and named diagnostics such as `backend-missing-runtime`, `backend-runtime-timeout`, `backend-runtime-malformed-response`, `backend-unsupported-os`, `device-unsupported-variant`, and `device-runtime-malformed-response`. A passing run means the shipped dashboard entrypoint, API truth, live updates, and operator-facing runtime visibility still agree with the M010 support contract.

## Dashboard entrypoint and live stream

The browser dashboard ships from the same Hono process as the API surface. Its job is to reflect the authoritative runtime truth model instead of inventing separate browser-only labels.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7600/
curl http://127.0.0.1:7600/dashboard-snapshot
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:7600/dashboard-events
```

- `GET /` returns the packaged dashboard HTML entrypoint.
- `GET /dashboard.js` returns the browser client bundle served by the same runtime.
- `GET /dashboard-snapshot` returns the authoritative browser snapshot contract.
- `GET /dashboard-events` keeps browser clients synchronized through a read-only SSE stream.

When the CLI is started with `--host 0.0.0.0`, those same routes are reachable from the LAN at `http://<machine-ip>:7600/...`.

## Health and inventory checks

Use these endpoints after the server is up.

### Basic liveness

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7600/health
```

Expected shape:

```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2026-03-31T05:00:00.000Z"}
```

### Full inventory snapshot

Returns the authoritative snapshot, including native runtime readiness and device diagnostics. Expect backend readiness labels such as `ready`, `degraded`, `missing`, or `unsupported` when probing `dsview-cli`.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7600/inventory
```

### Refresh and return the full snapshot

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7600/inventory/refresh
```

Call this once after startup if you want the in-memory manager to pull the provider's current inventory into its authoritative snapshot immediately.

### Compatibility device list

Returns only device rows.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7600/devices
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7600/refresh
```

Immediately after startup, `/devices` reflects the manager's current authoritative snapshot, which starts empty until the first refresh. If you expect provider-backed devices, call `POST /refresh` first.

Use `/inventory` and `/inventory/refresh` when you need backend readiness and diagnostics. Use `/devices` and `/refresh` when the caller only understands the device-list compatibility surface.

When the CLI runs with `--provider fake`, the default inventory is empty. That mode is useful for liveness and route smoke checks, but allocation examples below need either:

- a real device ID returned by `/devices` when using the default `dslogic` provider, or
- a programmatically seeded fake provider, shown later in this README

## Lease and allocation flow

The server keeps a lease table alongside device allocation state.

### Allocate a device

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7600/allocate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "deviceId": "<device-id-from-/devices>",
    "ownerSkillId": "logic-analyzer",
    "requestedAt": "2026-03-31T05:01:00.000Z"
  }'
```

Success returns `200` plus the accepted device, `leaseId`, and `expiresAt`.

Allocation failures return `409`, including cases such as:

- `device-not-found`
- `device-already-allocated`

### Heartbeat an active lease

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7600/heartbeat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"leaseId":"<lease-id-from-allocate>"}'
```

Success returns `200` with a refreshed `expiresAt`. Unknown leases return `404` with `reason: "lease-not-found"`.

### Inspect leases

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:7600/leases
```

### Release a device

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7600/release \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "deviceId": "<device-id-from-/devices>",
    "ownerSkillId": "logic-analyzer",
    "releasedAt": "2026-03-31T05:02:00.000Z"
  }'
```

Success returns `200` and removes the matching lease. Release mismatches return `400`, including wrong-owner attempts.

## Live capture route

The HTTP surface also exposes live capture through the shared contracts:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7600/capture/live \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "session": {
      "sessionId": "session-1",
      "deviceId": "logic-1",
      "ownerSkillId": "logic-analyzer",
      "startedAt": "2026-03-31T05:01:00.000Z",
      "device": {
        "deviceId": "logic-1",
        "label": "Logic 1",
        "capabilityType": "logic-analyzer",
        "connectionState": "connected",
        "allocationState": "allocated",
        "ownerSkillId": "logic-analyzer",
        "lastSeenAt": "2026-03-31T05:00:00.000Z",
        "updatedAt": "2026-03-31T05:01:00.000Z",
        "readiness": "ready",
        "diagnostics": [],
        "providerKind": "dslogic",
        "backendKind": "dsview-cli"
      },
      "sampling": {
        "sampleRateHz": 1000000,
        "captureDurationMs": 4,
        "channels": [{ "channelId": "D0", "label": "CLK" }]
      }
    },
    "requestedAt": "2026-03-31T05:01:10.000Z",
    "timeoutMs": 1500
  }'
```

For real capture payloads, prefer building requests from the shared `@listenai/eaw-contracts` types or the `@listenai/eaw-resource-client` HTTP client rather than hand-writing large JSON bodies.

## Programmatic startup

If you need to embed the HTTP surface in another process, build the manager and server directly. This example seeds a fake device so allocation, heartbeat, and release flows are available without DSLogic hardware:

```ts
import {
  InMemoryResourceManager,
  LeaseManager,
  createDeviceProvider,
  createServer
} from "@listenai/eaw-resource-manager";

const provider = createDeviceProvider({
  providerKind: "fake",
  fakeInventory: [
    {
      deviceId: "fake-audio-1",
      label: "Fake Audio 1",
      capabilityType: "audio",
      lastSeenAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  ]
});
const manager = new InMemoryResourceManager(provider);
await manager.refreshInventory();
const leaseManager = new LeaseManager();

const server = createServer({
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 7600,
  manager,
  leaseManager
});

const startInfo = await server.start();
console.log(startInfo.url);

// later
server.stop();
```

`start()` resolves to `{ host, port, url }`. `stop()` shuts down the HTTP server and the background lease-expiry scan.

## Operational notes

- The default provider is `dslogic`; use `--provider fake` when you only need to verify the HTTP surface.
- The server scans for expired leases every 10 seconds by default and releases matching devices automatically.
- `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` trigger a clean stop in the packaged CLI.
- `GET /health` is liveness only. For `dsview-cli` readiness and diagnostics, inspect `/inventory`, `/dashboard-snapshot`, or the browser dashboard.

## Verification

Focused package checks:

```bash
pnpm --filter @listenai/eaw-resource-manager test
pnpm --filter @listenai/eaw-resource-manager typecheck
```

Slice verification seam for the M010 cross-platform support story:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-m010-s05.sh
pnpm run verify:m010:s05
```

Use the M010 S05 seam as the authoritative acceptance command for the shipped operator path. It proves stale-wording protection, focused dashboard/package truth, and the explicit support contract that keeps macOS `dsview-cli` live-proven for the classic DSLogic Plus path while Linux and Windows remain readiness-modeled with named diagnostics.

Repo-level verification paths that also exercise this package:

```bash
pnpm run test
pnpm run verify:s06
pnpm run verify:s07
```
