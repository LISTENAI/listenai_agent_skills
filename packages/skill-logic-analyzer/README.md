# @listenai/skill-logic-analyzer

This package is the canonical home of the logic-analyzer host assets and runtime surface. Hosts should consume the package-root exports from `@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer` and resolve the shipped docs through this package's metadata contract instead of treating the monorepo root as the source of truth.

If you are browsing the repository, start with this package's `README.md` and `SKILL.md`. New host integrations should document and import the package-owned surface directly.

## Canonical package-owned asset contract

The package publishes a machine-stable lookup contract in `package.json` under `listenai.skillAssets`:

- `skillDescriptor` -> `./SKILL.md`
- `readme` -> `./README.md`

Consumers that need to copy or inspect host-facing assets should read those package-relative paths from `package.json`, then resolve them within the package root. Paths that leave the package root are invalid.

## Codex install and export

The package ships a Codex-oriented installer CLI through the published bin:

```bash
listenai-logic-analyzer-install-codex <codex-skills-directory>
```

Use the command with the Codex skills directory you want to populate:

- Personal install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-codex ~/.codex/skills`
- Project install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-codex ./.codex/skills`

The installer creates a package-owned `logic-analyzer/` skill directory under the target path and copies the canonical package assets into it:

```text
<codex-skills-directory>/logic-analyzer/
  SKILL.md
  README.md
```

For example, the personal destination becomes `~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/`, and the project-local destination becomes `.codex/skills/<skill-name>/`; for this package, `<skill-name>` is `logic-analyzer`.

The installed files always come from this package's own `SKILL.md` and `README.md`, so package consumers should validate or customize the package-owned docs rather than a repo-root mirror.

## Claude Code install and export

Claude Code continues to use the package-owned installer CLI and the same package asset contract:

```bash
listenai-logic-analyzer-install-claude <claude-skills-directory>
```

- Personal install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-claude ~/.claude/skills`
- Project install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-claude ./.claude/skills`
- Installed layout: `<claude-skills-directory>/logic-analyzer/` containing `SKILL.md` and `README.md`

## Install and import

Prefer the published package surface:

```ts
import {
  createGenericLogicAnalyzerSkill,
  createLogicAnalyzerSkill,
  runGenericLogicAnalyzer,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerRequest,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerResult
} from "@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer";
```

Do not add a repo-root re-export or deep-import internal modules; use the package root as the main host-facing import path.

## Runtime surface

Use one of these exports from the package root:

- `createGenericLogicAnalyzerSkill(resourceManager, options?)`
- `runGenericLogicAnalyzer(resourceManager, request, options?)`
- `createLogicAnalyzerSkill(resourceManager, options?)`
- request/result types from the same package-root surface

Do not deep-import internal modules from host code.

## Request modes

Send one packaged request object in one of two modes.

Offline artifact mode keeps existing callers working and may omit `mode` or set `mode: "artifact"` explicitly:

```ts
import {
  runGenericLogicAnalyzer,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerRequest,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerResult
} from "@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer";

const request: GenericLogicAnalyzerRequest = {
  session: {
    deviceId: "logic-1",
    ownerSkillId: "logic-analyzer",
    requestedAt: "2026-03-26T00:01:00.000Z",
    sampling: {
      sampleRateHz: 1_000_000,
      captureDurationMs: 0.004,
      channels: [
        { channelId: "D0", label: "CLK" },
        { channelId: "D1", label: "DATA" }
      ]
    },
    analysis: {
      focusChannelIds: ["D0", "D1"],
      edgePolicy: "all",
      includePulseWidths: true,
      timeReference: "capture-start"
    }
  },
  artifact: {
    sourceName: "capture.csv",
    capturedAt: "2026-03-26T00:00:01.000Z",
    text: "Time [us],D0,D1\n0,0,1\n1,1,1\n2,1,0\n3,0,0"
  },
  cleanup: {
    endedAt: "2026-03-26T00:02:00.000Z"
  }
};

const result: GenericLogicAnalyzerResult = await runGenericLogicAnalyzer(
  resourceManager,
  request
);
```

Live mode starts a session, captures through the shared manager/client seam, and returns the nested `captureSession` payload on success:

```ts
const liveRequest: GenericLogicAnalyzerRequest = {
  mode: "live",
  session: {
    deviceId: "logic-1",
    ownerSkillId: "logic-analyzer",
    requestedAt: "2026-03-26T00:01:00.000Z",
    sampling: {
      sampleRateHz: 1_000_000,
      captureDurationMs: 0.004,
      channels: [
        { channelId: "D0", label: "CLK" },
        { channelId: "D1", label: "DATA" }
      ]
    },
    analysis: {
      focusChannelIds: ["D0", "D1"],
      edgePolicy: "all",
      includePulseWidths: true,
      timeReference: "capture-start"
    }
  },
  capture: {
    requestedAt: "2026-03-26T00:01:10.000Z",
    timeoutMs: 1500
  },
  cleanup: {
    endedAt: "2026-03-26T00:02:00.000Z"
  }
};

const liveResult = await runGenericLogicAnalyzer(resourceManager, liveRequest);
```

Keep the nested `session`, `artifact` or `capture`, and `cleanup` contracts intact. Do not flatten them into a host-specific schema.

## Result handling

Branch first on `ok` and then on `phase`.

Successful result:

- `ok: true`
- `phase: "completed"`
- Includes the allocated session, normalized capture metadata, waveform analysis output, and `captureSession` details for live runs

Failure phases:

- `request-validation` - top-level packaged request is malformed; no allocation was attempted
- `start-session` - the session seam rejected the request or allocation failed
- `live-capture` - live capture request validation, runtime failure, or malformed live artifact after allocation
- `load-capture` - the capture-loader seam rejected the offline artifact or the live artifact loaded from `captureSession`

Treat nested payloads as authoritative diagnostics. Do not replace them with new prose-only error summaries. Malformed HTTP transport payloads from `HttpResourceManager` should still surface as thrown transport/parser errors instead of being rewritten into fake typed runner failures.

## Explicit cleanup after success

A successful packaged run does not automatically release the device. When the host is done consuming `result.analysis`, explicitly end the session through the package-root surface to return the device to `free`.

This matters most for live runs: the packaged one-shot entrypoint leaves the lease allocated on success so hosts can inspect the returned session and choose when cleanup happens.

```ts
import {
  createLogicAnalyzerSkill,
  runGenericLogicAnalyzer
} from "@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer";

const result = await runGenericLogicAnalyzer(resourceManager, request);

if (result.ok) {
  const sessionSkill = createLogicAnalyzerSkill(resourceManager);

  await sessionSkill.endSession({
    sessionId: result.session.sessionId,
    deviceId: result.session.deviceId,
    ownerSkillId: result.session.ownerSkillId,
    endedAt: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

## DSLogic host support matrix

The packaged live DSLogic path is only live-proven on the Linux host path where the native `libsigrok` runtime is present and the probe succeeds. macOS and Windows remain readiness-modeled here: they reuse the same shared readiness vocabulary and diagnostics, but they are not claimed as equally live-proven capture hosts by this package.

| Host platform | Backend expectation | Shared readiness labels | Proof status | What operators should inspect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | Native `libsigrok` runtime is present and the probe succeeds | backend `ready`, classic DSLogic device `ready` | `live-proven` | Run the S05 gate, then inspect `backendReadiness[]`, device `readiness`, and any diagnostics returned by the resource manager. |
| macOS | Native `libsigrok` runtime may be absent from the host | backend `missing` when the runtime cannot be resolved; devices remain non-allocatable | `readiness-modeled` | Check for `backend-missing-runtime` in `backendReadiness[].diagnostics` before claiming host support. |
| Windows | The probe can find hardware while runtime confirmation still times out or variants remain unsupported | backend `degraded` on timeout, device `degraded` or `unsupported` depending on variant | `readiness-modeled` | Check `backend-runtime-timeout`, `device-unsupported-variant`, or `device-runtime-malformed-response` diagnostics instead of assuming the host is capture-ready. |

Keep the typed vocabulary from `@listenai/contracts` intact: device readiness is `ready`, `degraded`, or `unsupported`; backend readiness is `ready`, `degraded`, `missing`, or `unsupported`. Hosts should preserve those values in logs, browser surfaces, and operator docs instead of rewriting them into install instructions.

## Verification

Use the S05 gate when validating the packaged runtime boundary and the cross-platform DSLogic support story:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-m006-s05.sh
pnpm run verify:m006:s05
```

That gate is the intended operator-facing check for the packaged live proof plus the DSLogic support-matrix assertions. The package-specific focused checks that back the current S05 contract are:

```bash
pnpm --filter @listenai/skill-logic-analyzer exec vitest run src/generic-skill.test.ts
pnpm --filter @listenai/resource-manager exec vitest run src/dslogic/dslogic-device-provider.test.ts
rg -n "live-proven|readiness-modeled|Linux|macOS|Windows|verify:m006:s05" packages/skill-logic-analyzer/README.md packages/skill-logic-analyzer/SKILL.md
```
