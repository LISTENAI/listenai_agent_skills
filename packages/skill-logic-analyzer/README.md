# @listenai/skill-logic-analyzer

This package is the canonical home of the logic-analyzer host assets and runtime surface. Hosts should consume the package-root exports from `@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer` and resolve the shipped docs through this package's metadata contract instead of treating the monorepo root as the source of truth.

If you are browsing the repository, start with this package's `README.md` and `SKILL.md`. New host integrations should document and import the package-owned surface directly.

## Canonical package-owned asset contract

The package publishes a machine-stable lookup contract in `package.json` under `listenai.skillAssets`:

- `skillDescriptor` -> `./SKILL.md`
- `readme` -> `./README.md`

Consumers that need to copy or inspect host-facing assets should read those package-relative paths from `package.json`, then resolve them within the package root. Paths that leave the package root are invalid.

## Codex install and export

The package ships a Codex-oriented installer CLI through the published bin:

```bash
listenai-logic-analyzer-install-codex <codex-skills-directory>
```

Use the command with the Codex skills directory you want to populate:

- Personal install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-codex ~/.codex/skills`
- Project install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-codex ./.codex/skills`

The installer creates a package-owned `logic-analyzer/` skill directory under the target path and copies the canonical package assets into it:

```text
<codex-skills-directory>/logic-analyzer/
  SKILL.md
  README.md
```

For example, the personal destination becomes `~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/`, and the project-local destination becomes `.codex/skills/<skill-name>/`; for this package, `<skill-name>` is `logic-analyzer`.

The installed files always come from this package's own `SKILL.md` and `README.md`, so package consumers should validate or customize the package-owned docs rather than a repo-root mirror.

## Claude Code install and export

Claude Code continues to use the package-owned installer CLI and the same package asset contract:

```bash
listenai-logic-analyzer-install-claude <claude-skills-directory>
```

- Personal install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-claude ~/.claude/skills`
- Project install: `listenai-logic-analyzer-install-claude ./.claude/skills`
- Installed layout: `<claude-skills-directory>/logic-analyzer/` containing `SKILL.md` and `README.md`

## Install and import

Prefer the published package surface:

```ts
import {
  createGenericLogicAnalyzerSkill,
  createLogicAnalyzerSkill,
  runGenericLogicAnalyzer,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerRequest,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerResult
} from "@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer";
```

Do not add a repo-root re-export or deep-import internal modules; use the package root as the main host-facing import path.

## Runtime surface

Use one of these exports from the package root:

- `createGenericLogicAnalyzerSkill(resourceManager, options?)`
- `runGenericLogicAnalyzer(resourceManager, request, options?)`
- `createLogicAnalyzerSkill(resourceManager, options?)`
- request/result types from the same package-root surface

Do not deep-import internal modules from host code.

## Request shape

Send a single packaged request object:

```ts
import {
  runGenericLogicAnalyzer,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerRequest,
  type GenericLogicAnalyzerResult
} from "@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer";

const request: GenericLogicAnalyzerRequest = {
  session: {
    deviceId: "logic-1",
    ownerSkillId: "logic-analyzer",
    requestedAt: "2026-03-26T00:01:00.000Z",
    sampling: {
      sampleRateHz: 1_000_000,
      captureDurationMs: 0.004,
      channels: [
        { channelId: "D0", label: "CLK" },
        { channelId: "D1", label: "DATA" }
      ]
    },
    analysis: {
      focusChannelIds: ["D0", "D1"],
      edgePolicy: "all",
      includePulseWidths: true,
      timeReference: "capture-start"
    }
  },
  artifact: {
    sourceName: "capture.csv",
    capturedAt: "2026-03-26T00:00:01.000Z",
    text: "Time [us],D0,D1\n0,0,1\n1,1,1\n2,1,0\n3,0,0"
  },
  cleanup: {
    endedAt: "2026-03-26T00:02:00.000Z"
  }
};

const result: GenericLogicAnalyzerResult = await runGenericLogicAnalyzer(
  resourceManager,
  request
);
```

Keep the nested `session`, `artifact`, and `cleanup` contracts intact. Do not flatten them into a host-specific schema.

## Result handling

Branch first on `ok` and then on `phase`.

Successful result:

- `ok: true`
- `phase: "completed"`
- Includes the allocated session, normalized capture metadata, and waveform analysis output

Failure phases:

- `request-validation` - top-level packaged request is malformed; no allocation was attempted
- `start-session` - the session seam rejected the request or allocation failed
- `load-capture` - the capture-loader seam rejected the artifact or found it incompatible with the allocated session

Treat nested payloads as authoritative diagnostics. Do not replace them with new prose-only error summaries.

## Explicit cleanup after success

A successful packaged run does not automatically release the device. When the host is done consuming `result.analysis`, explicitly end the session through the package-root surface to return the device to `free`.

```ts
import {
  createLogicAnalyzerSkill,
  runGenericLogicAnalyzer
} from "@listenai/skill-logic-analyzer";

const result = await runGenericLogicAnalyzer(resourceManager, request);

if (result.ok) {
  const sessionSkill = createLogicAnalyzerSkill(resourceManager);

  await sessionSkill.endSession({
    sessionId: result.session.sessionId,
    deviceId: result.session.deviceId,
    ownerSkillId: result.session.ownerSkillId,
    endedAt: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}
```

## Verification

Use the layered gates when validating the shipped template boundary:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-m004-s04.sh
pnpm run verify:s04
```

The S04 gate reruns the lower S02 and S03 installer gates first, then executes the focused CLI assembly proof in `src/host-skill-install-cli.test.ts`. That top-layer proof keeps the documented usage text, success output, and host-specific failure diagnostics aligned with the shipped Claude and Codex entrypoints.

For package-focused development inside this workspace, the narrower checks still exist:

```bash
pnpm --filter @listenai/skill-logic-analyzer test -- --run src/package-asset-contract.test.ts src/generic-skill.test.ts src/host-skill-install-cli.test.ts
pnpm --filter @listenai/skill-logic-analyzer typecheck
```
