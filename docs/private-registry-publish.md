# Private Registry Publish Automation

This repository publishes four private `@listenai/*` packages to the ListenAI npm registry:

1. `@listenai/eaw-contracts`
2. `@listenai/eaw-resource-client`
3. `@listenai/eaw-resource-manager`
4. `@listenai/eaw-skill-logic-analyzer`

Registry URL:

```text
https://registry-lpm.listenai.com
```

Do not commit `.npmrc`, `.yarnrc.yml`, registry tokens, or generated auth config. Local and CI publish paths use a temporary npm userconfig.

## Local Dry Run

Dry-run is the default and performs no registry writes:

```bash
bash scripts/publish-private-registry.sh --dry-run
```

Expected high-level output:

```text
[publish] Running consumer publish-readiness verifier
[m003-s04] Consumer publish-readiness verification passed
[publish] Completed dry-run for 4 package(s)
```

The script first runs `scripts/verify-m003-s04.sh`, then packs the four packages in dependency order, then runs `npm publish --dry-run` against each packed tarball.

## Local Auth Check

Before attempting a real publish, verify registry login state without publishing:

```bash
LPM_PASSWORD_BASE64=... \
LPM_USERNAME=... \
LPM_EMAIL=... \
bash scripts/check-lpm-auth.sh
```

For token auth:

```bash
LISTENAI_NPM_AUTH_MODE=token \
LPM_ADMIN_TOKEN=... \
bash scripts/check-lpm-auth.sh
```

The auth check writes only a temporary npm userconfig and runs `npm whoami` against the private registry.

## Local Real Publish

A real publish is intentionally awkward. It requires a confirmation word plus registry credentials. The default ListenAI registry auth mode is explicit password auth:

```bash
LPM_PASSWORD_BASE64=... \
LPM_USERNAME=... \
LPM_EMAIL=... \
CONFIRM_PUBLISH=publish \
bash scripts/publish-private-registry.sh --publish
```

The script writes password auth in this shape:

```text
//registry-lpm.listenai.com/:_password
//registry-lpm.listenai.com/:username
//registry-lpm.listenai.com/:email
//registry-lpm.listenai.com/:always-auth
```

`LPM_PASSWORD_BASE64`, `LPM_USERNAME`, and `LPM_EMAIL` are required in password mode; the script does not hardcode default registry identities. If password mode is not accepted by the registry, use token mode with `LPM_ADMIN_TOKEN`:

```bash
LISTENAI_NPM_AUTH_MODE=token \
LPM_ADMIN_TOKEN=... \
CONFIRM_PUBLISH=publish \
bash scripts/publish-private-registry.sh --publish
```

Token mode writes private-registry auth as:

```text
//registry-lpm.listenai.com/:_authToken
//registry-lpm.listenai.com/:always-auth
```

Safety gates:

- `--publish` fails unless `CONFIRM_PUBLISH=publish`.
- `LISTENAI_NPM_AUTH_MODE` must be `password` or `token` and defaults to `password`.
- Password-mode `--publish` fails unless `LPM_PASSWORD_BASE64`, `LPM_USERNAME`, and `LPM_EMAIL` are set.
- Token-mode `--publish` fails unless `LPM_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set.
- The script runs `npm whoami` before any real publish attempt so CI logs show whether registry authentication succeeds.
- The script checks every `package@version` is absent from the target registry before any real publish attempt.
- Registry config is written only to a temporary npm userconfig.
- The M003 consumer publish-readiness verifier runs before any package publish attempt.
- Packages publish in dependency order: eaw-contracts, eaw-resource-client, eaw-resource-manager, eaw-skill-logic-analyzer.

Real npm publish is not transactional. If a registry or network failure occurs mid-sequence, inspect the private registry manually before retrying.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Manual workflow:

```text
.github/workflows/publish.yml
```

Inputs:

- `dry_run`: boolean, defaults to `true`.
- `confirm_publish`: string, must be `publish` for a real publish.
- `auth_mode`: `password` or `token`, defaults to `password`.

Required secrets for password auth:

```text
LPM_PASSWORD_BASE64
LPM_USERNAME
LPM_EMAIL
```

Required secret for token auth:

```text
LPM_ADMIN_TOKEN
```

Recommended workflow usage:

1. Dispatch `Publish Private Packages` with `dry_run=true`.
2. Confirm the run completes verification and dry-run publish for all four packages.
3. Dispatch again with `dry_run=false`, `confirm_publish=publish`, and the intended `auth_mode` only when you intend to write to the private registry.

The workflow uses `permissions: contents: read` and passes `LPM_PASSWORD_BASE64`, `LPM_USERNAME`, `LPM_EMAIL`, `LPM_ADMIN_TOKEN`, `LISTENAI_NPM_AUTH_MODE`, and `CONFIRM_PUBLISH` only as environment variables to `scripts/publish-private-registry.sh`.

## Verification

Run the release automation guardrail checks locally:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-m004-s01.sh
bash scripts/verify-m004-s02.sh
bash scripts/verify-m004-s03.sh
```

`verify-m004-s03.sh` checks that docs, workflow, and scripts stay aligned. It also reruns the S01 and S02 guardrail verifiers.

## Non-goals

This milestone does not add automatic version bumping, changelog generation, GitHub release creation, git tagging, branch protection changes, or automatic publishing on push. Those should be added only after the release policy is settled.
